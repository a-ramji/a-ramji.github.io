    "text": "Anna Ramji grew up hiking and fishing along the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountain range, where she developed an interest in ecology and the impacts of climate change on native ecosystems. During her time as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, she worked as a research assistant and laboratory manager at Caldwell Laboratory, studying stomatopods and several species of octopus. Anna enjoyed taking extra-curricular courses in Data Science, Japanese, French, and Urban Design. She earned her Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Sciences with a dual focus in Biology and Chemistry, graduating with Honors in 2021. She has since worked to co-author a paper on body patterns of Octopus chierchiae with alumni from Caldwell Lab, which was published in PLOS One in April, 2023. Her interest in data science – particularly data visualization as a powerful tool for scientific communication – drew her to take additional courses in Python and R, and teach herself JavaScript to use Observable Notebooks. As a MEDS graduate student, she hopes to combine her expertise in environmental issues with her passion for data science and visualization to become an enthusiastic and inclusive scientific communicator in future roles. She is interested in working with ecological data, clean energy, and agroecology."

    "text": "AQI Data Analysis & Visualization\nWe could just go straight to plotting our AQI data over time in Santa Barbara County, but it would be interesting to also show a 5-day rolling average plotted on top of it.\nIn order to make our data visualization more legible, we can compute a rolling average of our AQI over time and add that as a column for our analysis.\n\nrolling() is a method for pandas.series that provides rolling window calculations\nthe parameter '5D' indicates we want the window to be 5 days\nThis is a lazy method (think groupby), so we need to specify what we want to calculate over each window\nwe’ll also use the aggregator function mean()\n\nthis indicates that we want the mean over each window\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# computing a 5-day rolling average of AQI \n# and inserting it as a new column at the end of the dataframe\naqi_sb.insert(loc = 5,\n             column = \"five_day_average\",\n             value = aqi_sb.aqi.rolling('5D').mean())\n\n\nGreat! Now we can make a line plot showing both the daily AQI and the 5-day average (5-day average on top of the AQI), using matplotlib\n\n\nCode\n# plotting our daily aqi and five day rolling average aqi on one plot\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(9,7))\n\naqi_sb.plot(ax=ax,\n            y = ['aqi', 'five_day_average'], # selecting two variables for my y-axis to auto-generate a legend\n            title = \"Daily AQI and 5-day average 2017-2018\", # updating title\n            xlabel = 'Date', # Updating x-axis label\n            ylabel = \"AQI (PM 2.5)\", # updating y-axis label\n            color = {'aqi': 'lime', # customizing colors\n                     'five_day_average':'blue'\n                    }\n           )\n\n\n&lt;AxesSubplot:title={'center':'Daily AQI and 5-day average 2017-2018'}, xlabel='Date', ylabel='AQI (PM 2.5)'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: we can see a huge spike at December, 2017. This is when the Thomas Fire occurred."
